# FTPbackup
Backup to FTP script

This script does the incremental backup of the folder to FTP.

This is done in two steps.

Step1: Tar the file and store into a local folder every day
Step2: backup the latest file from the folder once a week to FTP

This is a very simple script, which i use in my dedicated server avial.io
